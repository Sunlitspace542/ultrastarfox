# Map Macros
## Short blurb about maps
Levels (maps) in Star Fox essentially consist of a timed sequence of objects that spawn at certain points as the player gets further into the level.  
Honestly, you're better off looking at the existing level scripts and editing those to get your desired result, rather than writing a new level script from scratch. There's dozens of map macros, and it's unknown what a lot of them really do.
