 current valid triggers (for the P_TRIGGER instruction):
 TRIGGER should not use P_WAIT, P_GOTO, P_LOOP, P_WAITxxxx
 (anything which causes the next game frame to be displayed)
 (doing so will cause a blue BLINK |^) )

   Always             - calls the routine on every game frame
   2,4,8,...,128      - ... once every n frames
   WhenHit            - ... if hit
   WhenHitByPlayer    - ... if shot by player
   WhenFlagged        - ... if flag is set (clears the flag automatically)
   WhenDead           - ... if hp=0 (explodes regardless- but you can spawn)
   WhenShapeDead      - ... if the LINK'd or FOUND shape dies

 Global Variables:

 Global variables are available for use by all strategies they are
 completely independent of the strategy that uses them.. ie. if one
 strategy changes a global variable, another strategy can read or change
 it.  Use IMPORT to copy a global variable into an alien variable.
 Use EXPORT to copy an alien variable into a global variable.
 Global variables available for use:

   gbyte1        = global byte 1
   gbyte2        = global byte 2
   gbyte3        = global byte 3
   gword1        = global word 1
   gword2        = global word 2
   gword3        = global word 3

 NOTE: you can ONLY copy a byte into a byte or a word into a word, ie.
 you cannot copy a byte into a word or vice versa.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 Tables:

 The INDEX feature allows you to retrieve data from tables.  The index
 should be a byte alien variable, if it is a word then only the bottom
 8 bits are utilised.
 If the destination is a word then the index is automatically multiplied
 by 2 assuming you are indexing into a table of words.

 There are some default tables you can use:

   sintab - sine table (index should be 0-255, destination must be a byte)
   costab - cosine table (index should be 0-255, destination must be a byte)

 eg.
   P_SET   pbyte1,5
   P_INDEX pword1,mytab,pbyte1
   ...
 mytab
   dw      0,500,400,300,200,400,500

 This will set pword1 to equal mytab+5*2 (400)

 The Stack:

 The stack is used for DO-NEXT loops and GOSUB-RETURN subroutines.
 It is also used for the PUSH/PULL commands therefore there is of
 course some possibility of a clash.  You cannot PULL a variable
 from a level different to that from which it was PUSHed.
 ie.  P_DO    5
      P_PUSH  pbyte1
      ...
      P_PULL  pbyte1
      P_NEXT
 is valid, but:
      P_DO    5
      P_PUSH  pbyte1
      ...
      P_NEXT
      P_PULL  pbyte1
 is invalid and will probably crash
