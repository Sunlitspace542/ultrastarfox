## Features

## Cartridge Hardware Support and ROM Configuration

- Uses GSU-2/Super FX 2 @21.4Mhz instead of MARIO Chip 1 @10.7Mhz
- Super FX MS1 high-speed multiply enabled (if 21mhz is enabled)
- FastROM support (Do not enable if you are targeting a real cartridge with a real MARIO/GSU-1/GSU-2 IC chip!)
- MSU-1 support (Original ASM patch by Kurrono, ported by Kando and Sunlit) (**DEPRECATED, TO BE REWRITTEN**)

## Accessory Support

- SNES Mouse support and "analog stick" support via the SNES mouse
- SNES Rumble Pad support and macros (see ``SF\INC\RMBLMACS.INC`` for macros)

## QOL / Ease-of-use

- Very configurable, see ``SF\CONFIG\CONFIG.INC`` for more info
- Lots of free ROM space (2MB/16Mbit ROM)
- Bugfixes and improvements
- Build process optimized for speed
- Palettes and graphics crunched, textures interleaved, and fonts built at assembly
- Uses ARGLINK and ARGSFX from Star Fox 2 as linker and assembler instead of SL and SASM
- Easier creation of wireframe models (replace face3 and face4 with aface3 and aface4 in your shape file)
- Upload ROM directly to SNES and boot with QUsb2Snes and a SD2SNES/FXPak Pro flash cartridge

## Limits Removed/Increased

- 256 texture slots
- 250 faces/vertices limit for models

## Miscellaneous

- All Starwing PAL and Germany text/GFX for PAL builds
- **Kando and Randy were involved so you know it's good**

## Building

## Building on Windows

Requirements: Microsoft Windows

Download repo as ZIP and extract somewhere, or clone the repo with git via the command line.  

To build ROM, run ``build.cmd``.  

To build ROM with Logging, run ``build to log.cmd``.  

To clean, run ``clean.cmd``.  

After building, a debug symbol map will be created at, and a bank space report at ``BANKS.CSV``.  

## Building on Linux

**NOTE: this was tested on WSL with Ubuntu installed. YMMV.**  

Requirements: Ubuntu (might work with other distros) snap, DOSBox-X, git  

Install snapstore: ``sudo apt install snapd``  

Install DOSBOX-X from snap: ``sudo snap install dosbox-x``  

Clone repository: ``git clone https://github.com/Sunlitspace542/ultrastarfox``  

To build ROM, run ``make``.  

To build ROM with logging, run ``make log``.  

To clean, run ``make clean``.  

After building, a debug symbol map will be created at ``SYMBOLS.TXT``, and a bank space report at ``BANKS.CSV``.  

## Uploading ROM to SNES over USB with SD2SNES/FXPak(Pro)

Uses [USB2SNES-cli](https://github.com/Hyphen-ated/usb2snes-cli) fork by Hyphen-ated. A prebuilt windows EXE is provided.  
Download [QUSB2SNES](https://github.com/Skarsnik/QUsb2snes/releases).  
Extract it somewhere and run it. Set it up for an SD2SNES/FXPak Pro.  
**QUSB2SNES must be running in the background for uploading to function.**  
You can then run ``send2snes.cmd`` or ``build and send to snes.cmd`` to either upload the current ROM to the SNES or rebuild and upload the freshly built ROM.

## TODO

1. Optimize game where possible (We already have FastROM and 21Mhz SuperFX 2, can we go any further?)  
2. Annotate and document code (not so sure about doing this anymore)  
3. MAYBE: Disassemble all BIN files in SND directory, add documentation on custom music and the like
