# Textures
A short explanation of textures in Star Fox

## General Info
These are all the texture files for the final game (English + German), along with early files, backups, and misc textures found in the leak.
Textures in Star Fox are .CGX files which are interleaved using MERGE.EXE (found in TOOLS), which is how the .dat files in MSPRITES are made.

**sf1tex.col/sf1tex_yychr.pal** is a reference palette for textures that contains every variant in the source, found in the texture folder (this one).

**See _texpal_ref.txt_ for more info.**

## Editing/Viewing
For viewing these texture files, you can use SCAD (found in Gigaleak 2), or Hyper CG-CAD by LuigiBlood (hcgcad).
The latter option is better because of the raw import feature.

YY-CHR.NET and Tile Molester v0.20 are good options for editing textures.
v0.20 of Tile Molester natively supports .col files, but in the end it just boils down to preference.

**sf1tex.col can be used with both _SCAD and Hyper CG-CAD._**

**sf1tex_yychr.pal is for _YY-CHR.NET_ (SCAD specific stuff removed from file).**

All tools mentioned (except SCAD) are in the links section.

## Notes
- The first colour in each palette row of **sf1tex.col/sf1tex_yychr.pal** is transparent in-game
- The maping and misc textures are not drop in replacements for the final textures, they need to be defined
- Textures are defined in DEFSPR.ASM, entries are in COLTABS.ASM
