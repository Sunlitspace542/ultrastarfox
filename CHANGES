Version 2.0_01
- Hotfix: ENGLISH.INC and LANGUAGE.INC had unix line endings, causing assembler errors

Version 2.0
- All GFX and palettes crunched, all FXGFX interleaved when built
- Added player lives equate
- Hi-poly arwing replaces the low poly ship everywhere when hi-poly arwing enabled
- Added fontconv/foxfont by Phonymike
- Added option to disable SCRAMBLE sequence

- MOJI_0 and MOJI_D now built by the makefile using foxfont
- Fileslog removed
- Replaced SASM in palette building process with INCCOL custom tool, saves some time when building
- Move all palette fades to their own .COL files
- Added 30FPS unlock option
- SNES mouse BIOS not assembled unless mouse is enabled
- Added analog controls via SNES mouse (by Kando)
- Added assembler and MAKE.EXE documentation
- Compiler optimizations applied to sf_crunch, saving 5 seconds when building
- Remaining assembler heap printed in memory usage report for troubleshooting purposes
- Debug font moved into its own CGX file, added options for which debug font to use: Vanilla, SFEX, or Star Glider Alpha/SNESGlider
- Assembler now outputs BANKS.CSV, listing banks in the order they were processed and how much space (in bytes) remains
- MARIO chip registers now use official names from the SNES developer manual, moved from ALCS.INC to MREGS.INC
- SASM heap defined in makefile
- printrouln_on option fixed
- ANSI color codes disabled when assembler output is written to a LOG file
- All Super Star Fox Weekend (contest) code removed
- All CES demo code removed
- Added new game timer option, replacing the CES demo timer
- Added kandoprint macro for printing text using the debug font
- Added STRINGS.ASM and definestring macro to define strings to be printed with kandoprint
- The big one: codebase ported to ARGSFX (Star Fox 2's assembler)
- Custom patches applied to ARGSFX to fix some annoyances:
	- _SASM label undefined so the codebase can be made backwards compatible with SASM
	- CHECKMAC duplicate macro checking disabled by default so macros can be redefined
- Add ARGSFX, ARGLINK/SL and macro info to assembler manual
- Sound BIN labels renamed to indicate what data they contain
- Removed unnecessary write to CGRAM line 2
- ALLCOLS limit cracked, maxcolscru equate added to change limit
- Crash handler graphics and palette crunched to save ROM space
- ALLCOLS lines free, Xroutines space free prints added to memory usage report, assembler now will warn/fail if any memory space is full/exceeded
- Added character map defines for MOJI2.FON
- Fix case of BAT files for Linux
- Add bgconv background converter, add ports of bgconv and mugconv for Linux
- HUD hide on boss death separated from boostshieldcolorbox equate
- Texture folder updates by SegaRetro (PR #29,#30)
- Message test now actually loops through every message
- Option added to enable MAPMSG in the intro
- GFX equates for nova bomb icons
- Debug font is now properly trimmed down and included at assembly
- Added marioprint/marioprintdec macros to allow printing strings using MOJI_0
- Message box position equates added
- Text color parameter added to message macro, remove redundant message macros for other colors
- Simplified message macro to remove main/alt language text fields, all message files split into just their language, ENGLISH.INC split from JAPANESE.INC
- Language configuration moved from ROM.INC to LANGUAGE.INC
- Memory space checks simplified into macros
